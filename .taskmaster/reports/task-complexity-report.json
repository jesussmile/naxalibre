		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Research and Document LERC Bindings Generation Process",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the research and documentation process into granular steps: (1) gather and review all relevant source code and documentation for FlightCanvas Terrain and MapLibre, (2) conduct platform-specific analysis for iOS and Android native integration, (3) detail Dart FFI and C++ wrapper interactions, (4) map out the rendering pipeline from LERC data to terrain visualization, (5) perform a comparative analysis of MapLibre and FlightCanvas approaches, (6) evaluate integration options with pros/cons, (7) investigate technical feasibility and compatibility issues, (8) develop a detailed recommendation with implementation steps, benchmarks, and code/configuration examples.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep technical research, cross-platform analysis, comparative evaluation, and the creation of a comprehensive technical blueprint. It spans multiple domains (native code, FFI, rendering, documentation) and must result in actionable recommendations and detailed documentation. The breadth and depth of required analysis and the need for clarity for future developers make this a highly complex task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Establish Initial Directory Structure for Terrain Visualization Integration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the setup into: (1) create the top-level directory and all required subdirectories, (2) add placeholder files and initial documentation in each directory, (3) configure root and subdirectory CMakeLists.txt files for cross-platform builds, (4) validate the structure by running CMake and documenting the layout.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational setup task involving standard project structuring and basic configuration. While important for maintainability, it is straightforward and follows established patterns, requiring minimal technical depth."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TerrainLoaderScreen with Terrain Visualization Controls",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the implementation into: (1) review and document MBTilesLoaderScreen patterns, (2) design the TerrainLoaderScreen UI layout, (3) implement UI controls for opacity, tile size, and layer toggling, (4) connect controls to state management, (5) integrate controls with terrain rendering logic, (6) handle loading, error states, and user feedback, (7) document the new class and its interface.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves both UI/UX design and integration with rendering logic, requiring coordination between frontend and backend components. It is moderately complex due to the need for interactive controls, real-time updates, and robust error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Port LERC Decoder from FlightCanvas Terrain to Naxalibre",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the porting process into: (1) analyze and document the original LERC decoder logic, (2) design a modular Dart class structure for decoding, (3) implement file loading and header parsing, (4) implement pixel data decoding for all supported types, (5) add support for multi-band data, (6) write comprehensive API documentation and usage examples, (7) develop and run unit tests for all decoder features.",
			"reasoning": "Porting a binary decoder from one language and architecture to another, ensuring compatibility with a new codebase, and supporting all LERC features (including multi-band and various pixel types) is technically demanding and error-prone. It requires deep understanding of both the source and target environments."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Terrain and Hillshade Layer Rendering in Naxalibre",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the rendering integration into: (1) analyze FlightCanvas rendering classes and data flow, (2) refactor classes for Naxalibre compatibility, (3) implement terrain layer integration, (4) implement hillshade layer integration, (5) handle coordinate transformations and tile management, (6) ensure shader compatibility, (7) update map initialization and style configuration, (8) document integration points and configuration options.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves adapting complex rendering logic, ensuring architectural compatibility, and integrating with a new map system. It requires expertise in graphics, coordinate systems, and cross-platform rendering, making it highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Altitude Wheel Slider Control for Terrain Visualization",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the integration into: (1) review and decouple the original wheel slider implementation, (2) adapt the component for Naxalibre's architecture and state management, (3) integrate the slider into the terrain visualization screen, (4) ensure accessibility and cross-platform input support, (5) document new props, events, and integration points.",
			"reasoning": "While the UI control itself is not highly complex, adapting a custom component from another codebase and ensuring seamless integration, accessibility, and maintainability adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Terrain Caching System in Naxalibre Based on FlightCanvas Terrain",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the caching system into: (1) analyze and document FlightCanvas caching strategies, (2) design a modular caching architecture for Naxalibre, (3) implement data storage and retrieval logic, (4) implement cache eviction and memory management, (5) integrate with terrain streaming and rendering, (6) add configuration options for cache size and quality, (7) document configuration and usage.",
			"reasoning": "Designing and implementing a performant, modular caching system for terrain data—especially with dynamic preloading, eviction, and integration with rendering—requires advanced architectural and performance considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Test and Optimize Terrain Visualization Performance on Android and iOS",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the optimization process into: (1) profile performance on a range of target devices, (2) adjust quality and rendering settings, (3) implement adaptive LOD and multi-resolution modeling, (4) integrate performance tuning controls into the app, (5) configure timer intervals for overlays and updates, (6) document all optimizations and fallback settings, (7) iterate based on profiling and user feedback.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization across diverse mobile hardware involves profiling, tuning, and implementing adaptive systems. It requires both technical depth and iterative testing, making it a complex but well-bounded task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Document Terrain Visualization Functionality in Naxalibre",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation process into: (1) write usage instructions with code examples, (2) document native code setup and integration, (3) add performance optimization best practices, (4) link to or summarize related tutorials and resources, (5) review and test documentation for clarity and completeness, (6) update documentation based on feedback.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation requires clear communication, technical accuracy, and usability testing, but follows a predictable structure and does not involve deep technical implementation, making it moderately complex."
